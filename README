Please, contact info@ppsp.me if you have any comment or questions.

Here, I describe my development environment. You may use any other tools.

Eclipse

sudo apt-get install ia32-libs lib32ncurses5 lib32stdc++6 # need 32-bit libraries

Install SDK API 10 (I have my SDKs in ~/android/android-sdks/)

fork and get code from github (I have my code in ~/git/):
git clone git@github.com:username/tgs-android.git
cd tgs-android

Get jni (P2P C++ library) and compile:
git submodule init
git submodule update
cd jni

Get libevent2:
svn checkout http://svn.tribler.org/libevent2/tags/libevent-2.0.15-arno-http-android-14-binary/

In Eclipse: Run as > Android Application

Now, your phone is running the application. Open the browser (on the device) and type ppsp.me.
Follow the links to find ppsp.me links and select the ppsp_player app to open them.
After a (short) buffering delay, your device will start playing the video.
